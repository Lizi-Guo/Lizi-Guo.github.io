My name is Lizi Guo, (郭力子 in Chinese)，(pronounced Lee-zee Gwo).

I am currently a first-year math Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin–Madison. I am interested in topology and geometry.

I got my Bachelor degree at University of Liverpool and my Master degree at University of Cambridge (Part III).
